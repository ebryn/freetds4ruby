FreeTDS Ruby driver

To build:
ruby extconf.rb
make

Run the tests to see if it's working:
ruby test.rb

You'll need to obviously have FreeTDS installed first. Testing had occurred on Mac OS X 10.6.4 with FreeTDS 0.82.

For Unicode support, you need to be using a newer TDS protocol version, like 8.0. Otherwise you'll just get errors on retrieval.
