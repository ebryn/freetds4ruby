X better (faster) date parsing
    Using Time class currently. May need to use DateTime in some cases, but it's uber-slow.
    see link below for mysql2 example:
      http://github.com/brianmario/mysql2/blob/master/ext/mysql2/result.c#L183
      
    Date parsing speed in comparison to RubyODBC:
      It seems we're slower than ruby-odbc in this regard. I think that's because ruby-odbc
      passes along ODBC::Timestamp objects, which will later have to be converted to a compatible
      Ruby date type in ActiveRecord. This can be seen in the SQL Server adapter and is a 
      known performance hit. Therefore, it's hard to make an apples-to-apple comparison between
      the FreeTDS adapter and the Ruby-ODBC adapter speed.
- make sure column names have the same object_id, per ken collins' recommendation.

- pass sql errors through to ruby
X null value detection
X better integer conversion?
X clean up comments and unused variables in source
- statement handle drop
- memory leaks?
- benchmarks
- unicode?
- ruby 1.9?
- more tests, of course
- better bool testing?
X cs_get_data needed for large columns, but has restrictions on usage. 
  basically, the large column needs to be unbound, and no column 
  proceeding it can be bound either. see: http://tinyurl.com/2d5n353
